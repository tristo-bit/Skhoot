## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**CLI agents are powerful but trapped in terminal interfaces.** They output raw text, can't show visual file structures, lack voice control, and often run in sandboxes with restricted access.

**Skhoot changes everything:**
- ✅ **Full GUI** for agent tool execution with rich visual rendering
- ✅ **Unrestricted Access** - agents can execute any system command, access any file
- ✅ **Voice Control** - speak commands naturally, see real-time transcription
- ✅ **Multi-Provider** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or custom endpoints (bring your own API key)
- ✅ **Visual Workflows** - file explorer, terminal, and agent tools integrated seamlessly
- ✅ **Open Source** - complete transparency, extensible architecture

**This is the GUI that CLI agents deserve.**

```

**Token Tracking Features:**
- **Conversation Tracking**: Track tokens within the current conversation separately from historical data
- **Historical Data**: Full usage history with timestamps for period-based filtering (hour/day/week/month/all)
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Track usage across OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic
- **Token Estimation**: Automatic fallback estimation from text when APIs don't return usage (~0.25 tokens per char)
- **Dual Subscriptions**: Separate listeners for conversation updates and history changes
- **Persistent Storage**: Automatically saves last 1000 records to localStorage
- **Cost Calculation**: Estimated costs based on current model pricing (per 1M tokens)
- **Formatting Utilities**: Human-readable token counts (K/M suffix) and cost formatting
- **Model Pricing**: Built-in pricing for popular models (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, etc.)

**TokenDisplay Component:**

A compact UI component that displays real-time token usage in the format: `[Tokens: model-name] input/output`

```typescript
import { TokenDisplay } from './components/chat/TokenDisplay';

// Basic usage - renders token stats for last request
<TokenDisplay />

// With custom styling
<TokenDisplay className="my-custom-class" />
```

Features:
- **Last Request Focus**: Shows tokens from the most recent API request (not cumulative session total)
- **Compact Format**: Shows `[Tokens: model] input/output` (e.g., `[Tokens: 4o-mini] 1.2K/3.5K`)
- **Smart Model Names**: Shortens common model names (gpt-4o-mini → 4o-mini, gemini-2.0-flash → gem-2.0, claude-3-5-sonnet → sonnet)
- **Auto-Formatting**: Displays tokens as K (thousands) or M (millions) for readability
- **Animation**: Subtle scale animation on token updates
- **Tooltip**: Hover for detailed breakdown including last request counts, session totals, and estimated cost
- **Auto-Hide**: Only renders when there's actual token usage to display
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribes to tokenTrackingService for live updates

**Vision-Capable Models for Agent Mode:**
- **OpenAI**: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4-vision-preview`
- **Google**: `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Anthropic**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- **Anthropic**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`

**Available Agent Tools:**

## 📝 Recent Updates

<details>
<summary><strong>Enhanced Architecture with Context Providers</strong></summary>

**Centralized State Management**: App.tsx now uses React Context API for theme and settings management, providing better state consistency and performance.

- **ThemeProvider Integration**: Centralized theme management with automatic system theme detection
  - Supports light, dark, and system-based theme preferences

<details>
<summary><strong>File Explorer Panel Simplification</strong></summary>

**UI Cleanup**: Removed placeholder tabs from FileExplorerPanel to streamline the interface and reduce clutter.

- **Removed Tabs**: Links, Memories, and Bookmarks placeholder tabs removed from FileExplorerPanel
- **Simplified Navigation**: Panel now focuses on core file management features:
  - **Recent**: Recently accessed files with search and filtering
  - **Images**: Image gallery with grid/list views
  - **Disk**: Disk usage monitoring and visualization
  - **Analysis**: Storage analysis by category
  - **Cleanup**: Cleanup suggestions for reclaiming space
- **Cleaner Interface**: Reduced tab count improves usability and reduces visual noise

    - **Checking**: Yellow pulsing alert icon with "Checking backend status..." message
    - **Offline**: Red warning banner with clear error message and actionable instructions
    - **Online**: No indicator shown (silent success)
  - **User-Friendly Error Handling**:
    - Clear impact explanation: "Vision/OCR won't work"
    - Inline code snippet with fix instructions: `cd backend && cargo run`
    - Manual retry button for immediate status recheck
  - **Timeout Protection**: 2-second timeout prevents hanging on unresponsive backend
  - **Responsive Design**: Glassmorphic styling consistent with design system
  - **Flexible Integration**: Optional `className` prop for custom positioning

**Usage Example**:
```tsx
import { BackendStatusIndicator } from './components/ui/BackendStatusIndicator';

// Place anywhere in your UI
<BackendStatusIndicator className="mb-4" />

// Component automatically:
// - Checks backend health on mount
// - Polls every 30 seconds
// - Shows/hides based on status
// - Provides retry functionality
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- React functional component with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Fetch API with `AbortSignal.timeout(2000)` for request timeout
- Health endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health`
- Automatic cleanup with `clearInterval` on unmount
- Lucide React icons: `AlertCircle`, `CheckCircle`, `XCircle`

**Why This Matters**: Users immediately know when backend-dependent features (vision/OCR, file search, agent tools) won't work, with clear guidance on how to fix it. No more confusion about why features aren't working.

<button onClick={handleMinimize}>Minimize</button>
<div onMouseDown={handleDragMouseDown}>Draggable Area</div>
```
