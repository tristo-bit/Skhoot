# Product Overview

Skhoot is the first open-source GUI for CLI agents with unrestricted system access. It provides a production-grade interface that gives AI agents full system capabilities with voice control, visual file management, terminal integration, and workflow automation.

## Core Value Proposition

CLI agents are powerful but trapped in terminal interfaces. Skhoot provides a full-featured GUI that surpasses CLI capabilities while maintaining complete agent freedom - no sandboxing, no restrictions.
