# Development Log

## January 12, 2026

### README.md Overhaul
- Restructured entire README with collapsible `<details>` sections for better navigation
- Added GitHub-style social badges under banner (Star, Fork, Watch buttons)
- Collapsed by default: feature details, development info, recent updates, technical sections
- Visible by default: Quick Start, comparison tables, essential info
- Added Desktop vs Web comparison table
- Condensed verbose sections and improved visual hierarchy with horizontal rules
- Grouped Recent Updates into logical categories (Privacy, Help Center, Appearance, Audio, Search, UI/UX, Backend)
- Simplified browser compatibility and performance tables

### GitHub Pages Landing Website Complete
- Built complete marketing/landing page in `webpage/` folder for GitHub Pages deployment
- Design features:
  - Plus Jakarta Sans font (modern Twitter/startup style)
  - Skhoot owl logo SVG throughout (header, footer, favicon)
  - Light mode (#F0F0F0) and dark mode (#1e1e1e) with system preference detection
  - Animated floating gradient blobs in background
  - Glassmorphic UI elements matching the app's embossed style
  
- Sections implemented:
  - Hero with live app preview (iframe embedding actual Vite app in dark mode)
  - Stats bar (10ms search, 100K+ files, 3 platforms)
  - Features bento grid (6 cards): File Search, Voice Interface, AI Chat, Disk Analysis, Modern Design, Use Any AI
  - Tech stack "3T2R" (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Tauri, Rust) with proper SVG logos
  - Download section with OS auto-detection for "Recommended" badge
  - CTA section and footer with links
  
- Technical details:
  - Responsive design with mobile menu
  - OS detection via `navigator.userAgent` and `navigator.platform`
  - Smooth scroll, intersection observer animations
  - Matching 404.html error page

### Webpage Assets
- Added `webpage/skhoot-purple.svg` - Skhoot brand logo for the marketing/landing page
- This complements the existing `public/skhoot-purple.svg` used in the main app
- Webpage directory now contains complete branding assets for the public-facing site

### Project Structure Update
- Created `components/panels/` directory for organizing panel-related components
- This follows the existing component organization pattern with dedicated folders for:
  - `components/auth/` - Authentication components
  - `components/buttonFormat/` - Button variants and styles
  - `components/chat/` - Chat interface components
  - `components/conversations/` - Conversation display components
  - `components/main-area/` - Main content area components
  - `components/search-engine/` - Search functionality components
  - `components/settings/` - Settings panel components
  - `components/ui/` - Reusable UI primitives

### Backend System Spec
- Comprehensive backend system specification created in `.kiro/specs/backend-system/`
- Requirements document defines 8 major requirement areas:
  1. File Discovery and Indexing
  2. Content Search Capabilities
  3. AI Provider Integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
  4. Database Operations (SQLite)
  5. REST API Interface
  6. Configuration Management
  7. Error Handling and Resilience
  8. Performance and Monitoring

- Design document outlines:
  - Layered architecture (API → Service → Data layers)
  - 37 correctness properties for property-based testing
  - Component interfaces and data models
  - Error handling strategies

- Implementation tasks defined with incremental checkpoints

### File Search Integration
- Rust-based file search system documented in `backend/FILE_SEARCH_INTEGRATION.md`
- Multiple search engines: Rust fuzzy matching, CLI tools (ripgrep, fd), hybrid mode
- AI integration for intelligent search suggestions
- REST API endpoints for file and content search
- TUI interface for interactive terminal usage

### Current Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Desktop: Tauri (Rust-based)
- Backend: Rust with Axum framework
- Database: SQLite
- AI: Google Gemini integration via `@google/genai`
